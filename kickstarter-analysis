# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to filter the data to find disired outcomes, like outcomes based on launch date for plays. Then put this date in to a chart for better visualization of the data. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Chanenges of this project was the size of the project itself was causing excel to constantly crash or freeze. I made sure to have auto save on as well as hiting the save button myself often to prevent from losing the project. I also had some challenges with some of my formulas in the "Edinburgh Research" worksheet was not coming out correctly and I was unable to figure out what was going on and had to restart the whole challenge over again. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Two conclusions I have determined of the Outcomes based on launch date is 1- that the plays tend to have better out comes during the warmer months, mainly from May to August. 
2- Out of this conclusion we can determain that May overall had the best outcomes for Launch date 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The conclusion I have determained for Outcomes based off goals is that plays that range in the lower money range tend to do better than plays that were goaled at a higher range. 

## Results


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dateset is that the data does not give insite on how the plays did with reviews which is another factor in why some outcomes were successful or not. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other other possible tables/graphs we coudld create is any outcomes based off any of the subcatgories. We only did the data for the plays but any of the subcatagories we could make tables/graphs for the data.
